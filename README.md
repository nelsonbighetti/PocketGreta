## Description
Currently, on the territory of St. Petersburg there are cafes and shops that provide discounts to customers when using their containers. Also, there are separate waste collection points and organizations interested in using secondary raw materials. In addition, events are being held to educate the public about responsible consumption and environmental issues.
The main task of the proposed concept of the application is the aggregation of the above organizations, points and events in order to provide information about them to interested parties. In addition, the concept offers a unified system of bonuses to encourage and motivate users. The working title "Pocket Greta" was chosen for the project.
